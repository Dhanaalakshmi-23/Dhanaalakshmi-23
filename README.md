### 🌟 About Me
- 🎓 I'm currently an AIML undergrad, self-learning my way through cool projects and tech adventures!
- 💻 I enjoy turning coffee ☕ into code — especially web apps and ML models.
- 🧠 Always curious about how stuff works — from neural networks to browser animations.
- 🌱 Currently learning: **Machine Learning**, and how not to break my own code.
- 💬 Let’s geek out about **ML**, **Problem Solving** or even random internet facts.
- 📧 Reach out: **dhanaalakshminarayanan@gmail.com**
- 🎮 Fun fact: 📚 I learn best by breaking things first.
